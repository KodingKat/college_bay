In order to test the app, please follow the following instructions in order.

We recommend using Android Studio for testing, as it is what we have used.

1. Follow this installation guide for your operating system: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Open Android Studio, and click "Get from Version Control"
3. If you are promted to sign in to your Github account, do so
4. Paste this URL https://github.com/KodingKat/college_bay.git and click "Clone"
5. Once the project loads, ensure that Android Studio knows where your Flutter SDK is located.
6. Go to File -> Settings/Preferences -> Languages and Frameworks -> Schemas and DTDs
7. Do not worry about Dart, it will be pointed to once Flutter has been located.
8. Locate Flutter, and in the first box browse your system and locate the Flutter Folder.
9. Click Apply and you're ready for testing.


USING ANDROID VIRTUAL DEVICE MANAGER
In order to test the app on an emulator, follow these steps.

1. Locate AVD manager on the toolbar in the top right, click it.
2. Click "Create a Virtual Device"
3. Follow the steps for creating the device and Android version you desire.
4. Once finished, double click the device. It will take some time while the emulator starts.
5. Locate the emulator (sometimes starts in a seperate window depending on your version of Android Studio).
6. In the toolbar, ensure that main.dart is selected to run, and that there is a selected device. Click the Play button to run the app. Happy testing!
